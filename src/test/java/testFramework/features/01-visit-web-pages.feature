  Scenario Outline: Visit a the default SUT page
  Thus checks the defaults set in the SUT configuration.
  koalateasoftware.com does not have any built in redirection to https. Other sites may give you false negatives
    When I navigate to the page "<address>"
    Then the page title is "<title>"
    And the page scheme is "<scheme>"
    Examples:
      | address                         | title                 | scheme |
      # This template is pointed at http://koalateasoftware.com, which does not have a redirect to https
      | /                               | Web Site Development  | http   |
